                This pie chart displays the major factors that impact the enhanced greenhouse effect in Australia. It is evident that energy sources are the main contributors to Global warming, contributing to approximately 50% of the greenhouse effect. Furthermore Ultimately, the graph depicts the various sources that contribute to the greenhouse effect in Australia. These findings suggest that reducing emissions from energy production, transport, and agriculture could be key to mitigating Australia's greenhouse effect.

                The graph demonstrates how each year, the change in the number of dangerous fire days increases in many parts of Australia, including those which are densely populated. It evidently affects many Australians, specifically those living in high risk yet populated locations such as Melbourne, the Gold Coast, Darwin and Brisbane. 
The Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) uses the FFDI (Forest Fire Danger Index) to depict the varying values of forest fire danger, with the graph ultimately scoring above the 90th percentile of conditions from July 1987 to June 2024.
