                Overall, climate change is an ever-growing problem that continues to impact many in Australia especially in recent years.
                Various sources from all over Australia largely contribute to climate change, many of which modern day Australia is reliant on. 
                Thus, it is important that we continue to acknowledge its harm and do our best to stay sustainable in mitigating it.
