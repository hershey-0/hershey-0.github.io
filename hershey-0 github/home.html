            <h2>What is Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change is the long term shift in temperature and other general weather patterns. 
                Whilst changes can occur naturally, humans are responsible for the majority of such changes. 
                The rate at which temperatures have been rising in recent years has been extraordinarily high, and the 
                impacts of it have been very present in Australia. </p>
            <p>Climate change can be attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect. 
                Whilst the earth maintains a natural greenhouse effect which allows life on earth to continue, 
                the enhanced greenhouse effect accelerates rising temperatures due to anthropogenic activities. </p>
            <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>

                Climate change is important as it affects several different aspects of our lives. 
                These include our wildlife, ecosystems, energy and agriculture. Furthermore, it is a threat to 
                all life on Earth as it creates and enhances problems such as extreme weather events, food and water insecurity, 
                rising sea levels and health problems. If we continue to neglect the growing impact of climate change, it will eventually 
                lead to consequences that create irreversible damage.
